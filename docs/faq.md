## Introduction

### What is Flyable?

Flyable is a compiler and an IDE packaged with APIs for convenient Python development projects on the back-end and the front-end. Flyable makes your Python code up to 70x faster while using 80% less memory. Flyable generates executable files that can run on Windows at a high speed as well as WebAssembly instructions that enable your apps to run in a browser.

### How can Flyable be useful for me / Why should I use Flyable?

If you're looking to significantly increase performance on an existing Python project with no effort, Flyable is the platform for you! Compared to other solutions that make Python faster, Flyable doesn't require to modify your Python code in order to benefit from performance increases which results in development time economies.

### How do I get started?

It's simple! You can begin by downloading the Flyable package for your OS of choice. From the [download page](get-started.md#_1-install), you can follow our suggestions for getting started.

## General Python Compatibility

### How does Flyable work with Python?

Flyable is compiling Python code into executable files or WebAssembly instructions. To do this, it uses a type discovery algorithm and then makes optimisations before generating the desired output.

### Does Flyable support all versions of Python?

Flyable currently supports a subset of Python 3. It supports most of Python’s use cases. You only have to make sure that the typing of a data remains constant throughout its lifetime.

### Can Flyable make use of Python libraries?

Of course! We are working hard to enable you to use existing Python libraries with Flyable. Click here to see all the libraries that Flyable supports.

## Syntax

### Are there any differences with Python's syntax?

All the code that compiles with Flyable can be interpreted by the Python interpreter. The opposite is not always true for the moment, Flyable has some typing restrictions relative to CPython and is not supporting all Python libraries.

### Could I compile my pre-existing Python code?

Sure, as long as it stays in the bounds of the Python functionalities that Flyable supports right now.

## IDE

### How is the IDE designed?

The IDE has been designed to make its usage simple to understand and use in order to make the Flyable technology accessible to use.

### Do I have to use Flyable's IDE to use the compiler?

Yes, but we can integrate Flyable into your favorite tools.

## Performance & General Usage

### How does Flyable make Python faster and more lightweight?

The compiler applies strong optimization to your Python code before generating native executable on Linux, Windows or MAC

### How does the Flyable compiler work?

Flyable is compiling Python code into executable files or WebAssembly instructions. To do this, it uses a type discovery algorithm and then makes optimisations before generating the desired output.

## Development

### What are Flyable’s future development plans?

The Flyable team aims to make Flyable compatible with the major Python libraries for the Beta release. In the long-term, it is planned to make Flyable compatible with mobile operating systems and to add APIs to make ads publishing, payment methods, usage of DevOps tools and usage of cloud resources easier.

### Can I still be a part of Flyable’s development process?

Yes. To test Flyable before everyone else, request an invite to the Early Access Program by sending us an email at contact@flyable.dev! To contribute to open-source parts of Flyable, visit Flyable’s GitHub repository.
